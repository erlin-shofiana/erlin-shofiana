## Hi there, Erlin here👋 

### 🐸 About Me
<p align="justify">
Hello all! I’m <b>Erlin Shofiana</b> —  or you can call me Erlin for short. I'm a third-year Statistics student at <b>Universitas Gadjah Mada</b>, deeply passionate about statistics, data science, and machine learning.  
As a statistics student, I love diving into data and always strive to extract meaningful insights from it.

Through this profile, I’m excited to share my journey — from college projects to data competitions — where I explore various ways to tackle real-world datasets.  
I hope to keep learning, growing, and contributing in the data community!
